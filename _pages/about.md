I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Dartmouth College. I am advised by [Dr. Elizabeth Murnane](https://empowerlab.dartmouth.edu/about) in the Empower Lab. Prior to joining Dartmouth College, I did my undergraduate from Lahore University of Management Sciences, Pakistan in BSc in Computer Science. 

As an HCI researcher, I use participatory methods to co-design technologies that advance health equity among underserved communities. My interdisciplinary work integrates qualitative insights from interviews and surveys with quantitative data from wearables and mobile sensing. Broadly, my research spans two areas:

1. **Weight Stigma in Healthcare**: Conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how women seeking care for weight concerns experience stigma and how these interactions affect care coordination for co-morbid conditions such as cervical cancer. Using insights from interviews and participatory design, designed and developed a patient-facing educational tool that reframes obesity as a complex, chronic condition. The tool leverages narrative and interaction design to challenge stigmatizing framings and support more empathetic, holistic care approach.

1. **Digital Mental Health Interventions**: I lead research on the design and evaluation of human–AI systems that support mental health and well-being across diverse contexts, including enhancing the UX experience of [Evergreen](https://evergreenai.dartmouth.edu/), an AI-powered conversational agent designed to promote flourishing and overall mental wellbeing in college students. Additionally, I have been investigating the emotional toll of therapeutic work through interviews and social media analysis to inform the design of a cognitive support tool that helps therapists rescript self-critical or distressing thoughts. Finally, I have recently been involved in the study of early, data-driven detection of postpartum depression using wearable physiological and behavioral sensing.
